# üêç Control System Design with Python

## Introduction to Python for Control Systems

Python is a versatile programming language widely used in scientific computing and engineering. With libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Control](https://python-control.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), it provides powerful tools for control system analysis and design.

This tutorial will guide you through:
- Basic Python concepts for control systems
- Symbolic mathematics with SymPy
- Transfer function analysis
- System response visualization

### üîß Basic Python Concepts

Variables in Python are dynamically typed and easy to work with:

```python
x = 123.3        # float
x = "Some text"  # string
x = True         # boolean
```
Output:
```
Float: 123.3
String: Some text
Boolean: True
```

Engineers often work with signals (arrays), which are handled efficiently using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Create a numpy array
```
Output:
```
Basic array: [1 2 3 4]
```

Arrays can be created from individual variables:

```python
x1, x2, x3, x4 = 1, 2, 3, 4
x = np.array([x1, x2, x3, x4])
```
Output:
```
Array from variables: [1 2 3 4]
```

NumPy provides convenient functions for creating arrays:

```python
x = np.zeros(4)          # Array of zeros
y = np.ones((2, 2))      # 2x2 matrix of ones
z = np.linspace(0, 1, 5) # 5 evenly spaced points from 0 to 1
```
Output:
```
Zeros array: [0. 0. 0. 0.]
Ones matrix:
[[1. 1.]
 [1. 1.]]
Linspace array: [0.   0.25 0.5  0.75 1.  ]
```

### üîÑ Control Flow and Functions

Python's clean syntax makes control flow and functions intuitive:

```python
def square(x):
    """Square a number."""
    return x * x

x = 2
y = square(x)  # y = 4
```
Output:
```
Square of 2 is 4
```

### ‚ûó Symbolic Mathematics with SymPy

SymPy enables symbolic mathematics, which is crucial for control system analysis. For example, we can solve the quadratic equation:

$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

Or simplify trigonometric identities like:

$\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$

Here's how to do it in code:

```python
from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify, cos, sin

# Define symbolic variables
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Work with polynomials
pol = x**2 + 2*x + 1  # Represents (x + 1)¬≤
coeffs = pol.as_poly().all_coeffs()

# Solve equations
solution = solve(pol, x)

# Simplify expressions
result = simplify(cos(x)**2 + sin(x)**2)
```
Output:
```
--- Symbolic Mathematics Examples ---
Defined symbols: x y

Polynomial: x**2 + 2*x + 1
Coefficients: [1, 2, 1]

Solutions to x**2 + 2*x + 1 = 0:
[-1]

Simplifying sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2
Result: 1
```

### üéõÔ∏è Control Systems with Python Control

The `control` library lets us work with transfer functions and analyze system responses. For example, consider a second-order system:

$G(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 2s + 1}$

```python
import control
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create transfer function
num = [1]
den = [1, 2, 1]
G = control.TransferFunction(num, den)

# Get system information
zeros, poles, gain = control.zero_pole_gain(G)

# Plot step response
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
t, y = control.step_response(G, t)
plt.plot(t, y)
plt.grid(True)
plt.xlabel('Time [s]')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.title('Step Response')
plt.show()
```

The resulting step response plot:

### üìä First-Order System Comparison

Let's compare first-order systems with different time constants. The transfer function form is:

$G(s) = \frac{a}{s + a}$

where $a$ is the inverse of the time constant $\tau = \frac{1}{a}$.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from control import TransferFunction, step_response

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
t = np.linspace(0, 5, 1000)

for a in range(1, 6):
    G = TransferFunction([a], [1, a])
    t, y = step_response(G, t)
    plt.plot(t, y, linewidth=2, label=f'a = {a}')

plt.grid(True)
plt.xlabel('Time [s]')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.title('Step Responses of First-Order Systems')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

The resulting comparison plot:
